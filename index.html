        <h3>FOR the Proposition</h3>
        <!-- <h4>Wealthy Nations Are Leading the Fight Against Climate Change: Emissions Are Falling as Green Investment Rises</h4> -->

        <figure>
          <img src="for.png" alt="" />
          <figcaption>This visualization compares two key climate action indicators among 
            G7 countries from 2012 to 2021. The orange bars (left y-axis, log scale) represent 
            the total annual green bond issuance, showing growth in 
            climate-related financial investments. The dark blue line (right y-axis) displays 
            the average annual CO₂ emissions across G7 countries, smoothed using a three-year 
            moving average to highlight long-term trends. While emissions steadily declined 
            over the period and green bond issuance increased rapidly, this concurrent movement 
            supports the argument that wealthy 
            nations are actively engaging in climate mitigation efforts by both funding green 
            projects and lowering their carbon output.

          </figcaption>

        <p><b>Design Decisions and Rationale:</b></p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Use of dual-axis to show green bond issuance and emissions decline</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Score: +2</li>
              <li>Rationale: This design simultaneously highlights the rise in green investments
                 and the decline in emissions, visually reinforcing the proposition. I think it
                 works great because it shows the bi-change of the two element which shows the 
                 clear contribution of what wealthy nations have done to protect the climate.</li>
              <li>Alternative considered:
                I considered creating two separate plots — one showing green bond issuance and 
                another showing emissions decline. This would have made each trend easier to 
                analyze individually but would lose the immediate visual correlation between 
                the two variables. Another alternative was plotting them together on the same 
                axis, but their scales differ so much that one trend would visually dominate 
                and obscure the other.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><b>Applying log scale and smoothing to emphasize clean trends</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Score: -1</li>
              <li>Rationale: The log scale for green bonds allows a wide range of values to be 
                presented legibly, while smoothing the emissions line — achieved by averaging 
                values over a three-year window — removes noise to make the decline clearer. 
                These choices together help clarify the overall narrative without misrepresenting 
                trends. The trends became visually clean and interpretable, making the argument 
                immediately accessible. However, the early years with low green bond values looked 
                very compressed even with log scaling. Although both log scaling and smoothing 
                improve readability, I recognize that they can be considered mild deception 
                techniques. They enhance the visibility of upward and downward trends, making 
                the rise in green bond issuance and the decline in emissions appear more 
                consistent and persuasive than they might seem with raw data.</li>
              <li>Alternatives: I considered using linear scale and raw (unsmoothed) emissions data. 
                However, the linear scale would have made recent green bond growth appear too 
                extreme compared to earlier years, and the unsmoothed emissions line looked too 
                noisy to visually support a "consistent decline" narrative.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <!-- <li>Bold, slanted title explicitly stating the argument
            <ul>
              <li>Score: -1</li>
              <li>The title suggests causality between green bond growth and emission reductions, 
                which is implied rather than proven, thereby influencing reader interpretation. 
                What worked well: It framed the reader’s thinking from the beginning, making the 
                chart more persuasive. What didn’t: It could cause skeptical readers to question 
                credibility if they notice the causality gap.</li>
              <li>Alternatives considered: I considered using a neutral title ("Green Bond 
                Issuance and Emissions Trends") but decided the more assertive title better 
                fit the task of persuasion.</li>
            </ul>
          </li> -->
          <li><b>Highlighting G7 countries without showing non-G7 comparisons</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Score: -1.5</li>
              <li>Rationale: Focusing only on G7 may exaggerate their relative performance by 
                omitting other groups' achievements or failures. This choice created a simple, 
                uncluttered story that aligns closely with the proposition, making the 
                visualization easier to read and more persuasive. I recognize that displaying 
                only absolute data for G7, without providing a relative comparison to other 
                groups, constitutes a mild deception technique. By selectively framing the 
                narrative around a single group, the visualization amplifies their apparent 
                leadership while implicitly downplaying the broader global progress or setbacks. 
                Although this approach strengthened the persuasive effect, it risked 
                oversimplifying a more complex reality.</li>
              <li>Alternatives: I considered including global averages or a "rest of 
                world" group, but it would have introduced ambiguity and potentially weakened 
                the intended persuasive effect.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><b>Clear visual distinction between investment and emissions via color</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Score: +2</li>
              <li>Rationale: Strong contrasting colors were used to help readers distinguish the two 
                narratives clearly. The separation made the chart easy to read and minimized 
                cognitive load. The colors could be perceived as arbitrary and may not carry 
                inherent semantic meaning (e.g., green might be more directly associated with 
                environmental issues, which might be more matched to the theme).</li>
              <li>Alternatives: I briefly considered using shades of green, but they 
                would have been too similar and visually confusing for a two-axis chart.</li>

        <h3><b>AGAINST the Proposition</b></h3>
        <!-- <h4>Wealthy nations outsource emissions through high hidden CO<sub>2</sub> imports, not true climate leadership.</h4> -->

        <figure>
          <img src="against1.png" alt="" />
          <figcaption>This figure is composed of two combined plots. The upper plot displays 
            the average cumulative CO₂ emissions per country from 1970 to 2023, highlighting 
            the historical responsibility that wealthy nations bear for driving climate change. 
            The lower plot shows the hidden carbon emissions embedded in international trade 
            from 1995 to 2021, illustrating how wealthy nations have reduced their domestic 
            emissions partly by outsourcing high-carbon industries to other countries and 
            importing carbon-intensive goods instead. Together, these visualizations expose 
            the hypocrisy underlying claims of climate leadership by wealthy nations, emphasizing 
            both their historical accountability and ongoing carbon displacement practices.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p><b>Design Decisions and Rationale:</b></p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Concatenation of two related plots to build a comprehensive critique</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Score: +2</li>
              <li>Rationale: Combining cumulative emissions with hidden CO₂ imports emphasizes 
                both historical and ongoing contributions to climate change. Together, the two 
                plots made the argument multifaceted and difficult to dismiss.
                However, presenting two plots in one space risks overwhelming or confusing 
                some viewers.</li>
              <li>Alternatives: I considered using only the hidden imports chart, but decided 
                that cumulative responsibility was too important to omit for a full critique.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>

            <ul>
              <li>Score: +1.5</li>
              <li>Rationale: The stacked format clearly highlights the consistently larger hidden 
                imports from G7 countries. It made the G7's contribution 
                visually dominant at a glance, without needing detailed explanation.
                But some readers might misinterpret the stacking as direct emissions, 
                not imported emissions, if they skim quickly.</li>
              <li>Alternatives: I thought about using side-by-side bars but found stacking better 
                conveyed cumulative visual dominance over time. Also, it straight-forwardly 
                shows the high proportion 
                of wealthy country.</li>

              <li>Score: -0.5</li>
              <li>Rationale: The critical wording ("not true climate leadership") immediately 
                positions the viewer to doubt G7 actions. It aligned the reader 
                emotionally with the intended argument early.
                But it could appear too biased, potentially alienating skeptical audiences.</li>
              <li>Alternatives: I considered a neutral title ("G7 Hidden Emissions and Historical 
                Responsibility") but found it lacked rhetorical strength for persuasive goals.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li><b>Use per country normalization instead of per capita normalization</b>
            <ul>
              <li>Score: -1.5</li>
              <li>Rationale: Although I did not perform a full normalization by population size, 
                I recognize that adjusting for population might lead to different results — 
                the G7's share of responsibility could either appear smaller or, in some cases, 
                even larger. Regardless of the direction, per capita normalization would more 
                accurately reflect the true scale of responsibility relative to population, 
                compared to the current per-country averaging method. Using absolute averages 
                likely exaggerates G7 culpability by overlooking differences in country size and 
                economic scale.</li>
              <li>Alternatives: I considered showing per capita or GDP-normalized emissions, 
                but they would have diminished the starkness of the contrast. Moreover, 
                incorporating population data would require introducing an additional dataset, 
                which would increase the complexity of the visualization and potentially dilute 
                the immediate persuasive impact.</li>

            <ul>
              <li>Score: +1</li>
              <li>Rationale: Explicitly placing the large percentage on the bar draws immediate 
                attention to historical emissions dominance. It made the 
                argument extremely clear in one glance without cluttering the visual.
                But it might oversimplify a complex historical trend by reducing it to 
                a single percentage.</li>
              <li>Alternatives:I considered showing detailed year-by-year breakdowns, but the 
                cleaner single-percentage summary was far more persuasive.</li>

        <h2>Final Reflection</h2>

        <p>One of the most difficult parts of the design process was selecting a main 
          proposition and then generating both for and against arguments — and supporting data — 
          for both sides. With so many CSV files and columns available, it was challenging 
          to filter and extract subsets of data that could meaningfully reinforce both the 
          supportive and opposing viewpoints. It was also nontrivial to determine which 
          types of charts, such as line graphs versus bar charts, would most effectively 
          communicate each side's narrative. Choosing the appropriate chart type directly 
          influenced the perceived strength and clarity of the argument, making this a 
          critical and sometimes difficult decision.
          <br>
          <br>
          An aspect that was somewhat more straightforward — yet still presented subtle 
          challenges — was color selection. On the one hand, I found it easier because 
          I naturally gravitate toward certain color palettes, which provided a starting point. 
          However, it was difficult to strike the right balance: selecting colors that offered 
          sufficient contrast to separate key elements, while still maintaining visual harmony 
          and avoiding distracting clashing tones. What surprised me most throughout this process 
          was realizing just how flexibly visualizations can be crafted to persuasively support 
          completely opposite viewpoints. With deliberate framing and design choices, both the 
          affirmative and opposing cases could be made highly convincing, even when drawn from 
          the same overall data source.

          Through this exercise, I have come to define <b>"ethical analysis and visualization"</b> as 
          the responsibility to accurately reflect underlying data patterns, even while 
          acknowledging that framing decisions will inevitably shape interpretation. Ethical 
          visualizations strive for clarity without obscuring critical context. In distinguishing 
          between <b>“acceptable” persuasive choices and “misleading” ones</b>, I believe the boundary 
          lies in whether the visualization fundamentally distorts or omits key information that 
          would alter a viewer's understanding. Strategic emphasis and careful selection are 
          acceptable; deliberate concealment or manipulation crosses the line into unethical 
          territory. This project highlighted how small decisions — from smoothing data to 
          omitting certain comparisons — can tilt perceptions, and it deepened my appreciation 
          for the nuanced balance between persuasion and integrity in data storytelling.</p>
